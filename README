Originally written for: http://www.moparscape.org/serverstatus.php
I plan to keep the repository up to date with the currently running
code at all times.

Features:
----------------------
1. Integration with SMF forum, but extensible to other forums as well (check ss_sources/forums/).
2. Premium (Sponsored) server support.
3. Layout entirely configurable from CSS (theme support in ss_sources/themes/).
4. Full WYSIWYG editor and bbcode support thanks to SMF.
5. IP owner verification.
6. Voting support. (with optional ReCaptcha verification)
7. Dynamic status images, with clean URL support.
8. Can sort by all meaningful table columns.
9. Uses MySQLi.
10. Search powered by the fast Sphinx Search Server.

How to make it work:
----------------------
1. Copy ss_sources/copy_edit_me.php to where you want the script to run
(like /serverstatus.php) and fill in all config details. You can copy
to multiple locations with different details to run multiple instances
of the application with the same codebase.
2. Create databases by importing database.sql
3. Setup sphinx server if you want search.
4. If you want clean URLs to work with the dynamic status images,
you must create the relevant URL rewrite. In lighttpd, it looks like this:
    url.rewrite-once = (
    "^/serverstatus/([^/]*)\.png$" => "/serverstatus.php?action=image&server=$1",
    "^/serverstatus/([^/]*)/([^/]*)\.png$" => "/serverstatus.php?action=image&scale=$1&server=$2",
    )
5. Compile and set up the ServerChecker java maven project (mvn package)
to automatically approve and check the status of servers as a cronjob.
6. Run it, I suggest Lighttpd+FastCGI.

How to comply with License:
----------------------
Basically, the AGPL requires that if you distribute the code,
or if you host the application where the public can access it,
such as a public server status page, then you must provide the
source code along with your modifications as a download on that
page.  This is to promote development of the program and share
code with everyone to improve it.  If you have any questions, 
contact me at admin@moparisthebest.com.  If you use the code, 
I'd love to know, so drop me a line if you would.
